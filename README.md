# OIBSIP Data Science Internship – Task 1

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform Iris Flower Classification using machine learning as part of the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship (OIBSIP).

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a standard dataset used for classification problems. It contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different iris flower species.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Algorithm Used
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used to classify iris flowers based on similarity between feature values.

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries
2. Loaded the Iris dataset
3. Explored and understood the dataset
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Applied the KNN algorithm
6. Evaluated the model accuracy

## Outcome
The model successfully classifies iris flowers into their respective species with good accuracy.
