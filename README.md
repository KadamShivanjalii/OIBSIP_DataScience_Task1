# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task1
This repository contains the implementation of Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning as part of the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship (OIBSIP). The project uses the Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species based on their features using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
