## Project Title
Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification task using the Iris flower dataset.  
The goal is to classify iris flowers into different species based on their physical features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project is implemented using Python and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and executed using Google Colab.

---

## Objective
To build and evaluate a machine learning model that accurately classifies iris flower species using the KNN algorithm.

---

## Algorithm Used
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
